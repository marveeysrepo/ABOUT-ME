            <h1>Marveey Goodlife</h1>
             <p>I'm  a  website developer dedicated to building stylish, functional websites that help people and individual succeed. </p>
             <p>
                My interest for web design came in a curious way. When i first started using a computer in 2019, I found myself clicking "inspect" on web pages and diving into the code. I had no idea what it was at that time.
            
                 Seeing how I could change things on the screen by just tweaking a few lines of code on the Google developer environment was like a superpower. It was then that I knew i wanted to be more than just a user, i wanted to be a creator.
             
                What started as a childhood curiosity has now become a passion for solving problems and bringing ideas live on the web.
